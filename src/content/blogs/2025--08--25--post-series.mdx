Sometimes you create several articles that can be grouped as a Post Series. You handpicked/curated those posts into one category,
but doesn't want to show it as categories.

This is like making index page, but you curated the list by yourself

To do this, in the MDX page, you fetch the post first and do filter/ordering to create the collections.
Then pass it to the Astro component to render the pages

import { getPosts, filterPostsByCategory, getPostByTag } from '@/utils'
import PostListCard from '@/components/PostListCard'

<PostListCard
	displayAsRows={true}
	posts={(await getPosts()).filter(function (post) {
		debugger
		return post.data.category.name === 'blogs'
	})}
/>
